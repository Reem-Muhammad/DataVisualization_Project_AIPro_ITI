# **Project description**
Creating an interactive dashboard using [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/); a framework created by plotly.  

Our dashboard enables the user to try different settings for a machine learning pipeline (different features, models and hyperparameters), and explore how it affects the performance.  

The data used is the [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset?select=cardio_train.csv) from kaggle
